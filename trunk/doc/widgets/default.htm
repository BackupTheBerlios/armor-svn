<h1>Visual Programming &amp; Widgets</h1>

<p>Orange's graphical user interface revolves around data mining
components called widgets and visual programming as a tool to assemble
the widgets into applications and use them (in any way and combination
you requeire) for explorative data analysis. We here list the
resources that can help you familiarize with widgets and visual
programming as a user or as a widget developer.</p>

<h2>White Papers and Flyers</h2>

<dl>
<dt><a href="/orange/wp/orange-leaflet-visual.pdf">Orange Visual
Programming</a></dt>
<dd>Starter for visual programming in Orange, Orange widgets and data
mining schemas.</dd>

<dt><a href="/orange/wp/orange widgets.pdf">Orange Widgets</a></dt>
<dd>A white paper on Orange widgets gives a brief overview of how our
visual programming interface with GUI commponents we call widgets are
used to do explorative data analysis and visually construct
applications of your need.</dd>

<h2>Widget Catalog</h2>

<dl>
<dt><a href="catalog/default.asp">Catalog of Orange Widgets</a></dt>
<dd>For every Orange widgets tells what it does, describes its inputs
     and outputs and gives ideas how it is used in relation to other
     widgets.</dd>

<h2>Documentation for Developers</h2>

<p>We have spent much time on writing many widgets in the past several
years. While we really like widgets, and we even like programming them
(as having a nice visual component of your own can be really
rewarding), we also got a bit lazy. Being lazy is intrinsic to any
human, so we aimed at minimizing our effort (e.g., fewest lines
possible) while maximizing the outcome (building some nice widgets
fast). To do this, we have set up the environment (base widget class)
and several libraries to please us, the developers. If you are about
to start writing your own widgets, or are just interested how we do
it, the following documentation should get you started.</p>
