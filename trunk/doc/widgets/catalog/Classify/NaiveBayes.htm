<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This widget provides a graphical interface to the Naive Bayesian classifier.</p>

<p>As all widgets for classification, this widget provides a learner and classifier on the output. Learner is a learning algorithm with settings as specified by the user. It can be fed into widgets for testing learners, for instance <code>Test Learners</code>. Classifier is a Naive Bayesian Classifier (a subtype of a general classifier), built from the training examples on the input. If examples are not given, the widget outputs no classifier.</p>

<td valign="top">
<P>Learner can be given a name under which it will appear in, say, <code>Test Learners</code>. The default name is "Naive Bayes".</P>

<P>Next come the probability estimators. <b>Unconditional</b> sets the method used for estimating prior class probabilities from the data. You can use either relative frequencies, Laplace estimate or m-estimate. <b>Conditional (discrete)</b> sets the method for estimating conditional probabilities. You can use any of the three options above or set the method to be the same as for ``unconditional''. Finally, <b>Conditional (continuous)</b> specifies the method used for estimatin conditional probability for continuous attributes. We suggest LOESS; other settings are untested and may not work.</P>

<P>When using m-estimate, the value of <em>m</em> parameter is set in <b>Parameter for m-estimate</b>. Similarly, when using LOESS, you can set the <b>Size of LOESS window</b>.</P>

<P>If the class is binary, the classification accuracy may be increased considerably by letting the learner find the optimal classification threshold (option <b>Adjust threshold</b>). The threshold is computed from the training data. If left unchecked, the usual threshold of 0.5 is used.</P>

<P>When you change one or more settings, you need to push <b>Apply</b>; this will put the new learner on the output and, if the training examples are given, construct a new classifier and output it as well.</P>

<P>There are two typical uses of this widget. First, you may want to induce the model and check what it looks like in a <a href="Nomogram.htm">Nomogram</a>.</P>

<P>The second schema compares the results of Naive Bayesian learner with another learner, a C4.5 tree.</P>
