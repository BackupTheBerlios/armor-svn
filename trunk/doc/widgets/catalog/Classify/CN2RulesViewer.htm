<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This widget is used for visualizing rules learned by rule learning widgets (e.g. CN2). It has two parts; the left part is used for controlling what of and how rules should be presented, while the right part (the bigger part in figure) shows rules. As you can see the viewer can, along pre-conditions and prediction of rule, show several rule parameters like quality, number of covered examples, length, and distribution of class variable (among covered examples). Moreover, these criteria can also be used for sorting rules.
</p>

<p> Another important feature of widget is that it allows selection of rules (one or several at a time). The selection of rules sends covered examples of these rules (a disjunction when several are selected) to the output signal.
