<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This widget provides a graphical interface to the classification tree learning algorithm.</p>

<p>As all widgets for classification, this widget provides a learner and classifier on the output. Learner is a learning algorithm with settings as specified by the user. It can be fed into widgets for testing learners, for instance <code>Test Learners</code>. Classifier is a Classification Tree Classifier (a subtype of a general classifier), built from the training examples on the input. If examples are not given, the widget outputs no classifier.</p>

<P>Learner can be given a name under which it will appear in, say, <code>Test Learners</code>. The default name is "Classification Tree".</P>

<P>The first block of options deals with the <b>Attribute selection criterion</b>, where you can choose between the information gain, gain ratio, gini index and ReliefF. For the latter, you can set the number of <b>reference examples</b> (more examples gives more accuracy and less speed) and the number of <b>neighbours</b> considered in the estimation. <b>Bug</b>: ReliefF doesn't work with continuous attributes.</P>

<P>If you set the <code>Binarization</code>, the values of multivalued attributes will be split into two groups (based on the statistics in the particular node) to yield a binary tree. Binarization gets rid of the usual measures' bias towards attributes with more values and is generally recommended.</P>

<P>Pruning during induction can be based on the <b>Minimal number of instance in leaves</b>; if checked, the algorithm will never use a split which would put less than the specified number of training examples into one of the branches. You can also tell the algorithm to <b>Stop splitting the nodes with</b> less than the given number of instances or the nodes with a large enough majority class.</P>

<P>During induction, the algorithm can produce a tree in which entire subtrees predict the same class, but with different probabilities. This can increase probability based measures of classifier quality, like the Brier score or AUC, but the trees tend to be much larger and more difficult to grasp. To avoid it, tell it to <b>Recursively merge the leaves with same majority class</b>.</P>

<P>You can also enable <b>Pruning with m-estimate</b> and specify the value of <em>m</em> parameter.</P>

<P>After changing one or more settings, you need to push <b>Apply Changes</b>, which will put the new learner on the output and, if the training examples are given, construct a new classifier and output it as well.</P>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<P>There are two typical uses of this widget. First, you may want to induce the model and check what it looks like. You do it with the schema below; to learn more about it, see the documentation on <a href="ClassificationTreeGraph.htm">Classification Tree Graph</a>.</P>

<P>The second schema checks the accuracy of the algorithm.</P>
