<H1>Other file formats</H1>

<P>Besides the custom formats (tab-delimited, basket etc) Orange can read the
data from several common file formats: C4.5, Assistant and Retis. If you want to
use these formats, see the documentation in the corresponding packages.</P>

<P>C4.5 and C5 formats are not the same. The latter is (overly) complex, so only a limited support (if any) is planned in future versions of Orange if there is enough interest.</P>
